# Standup Wiki

## Live Website

Experience Standup Wiki live at [www.standupwiki.com](https://www.standupwiki.com). Explore your favorite standup comedians and specials, and engage with a community of fellow comedy enthusiasts.


## Project Overview

Standup Wiki is a unique web platform dedicated to standup comedy enthusiasts. It aggregates a comprehensive collection of standup comedians and their specials, offering a singular destination for fans to explore, watch, and engage with content. This project aims to fill the gap in the market where no existing platform provides a vertical focus exclusively on standup comedy.

### Why Standup Wiki?

- **Centralized Hub:** Unlike official platforms like Comedy Central, Netflix, and HBO, which are limited to their in-house content, Standup Wiki encompasses a wide range of comedians and specials.
- **Reliability and Maintenance:** Addresses the issues of existing platforms like dead-frog and comedybuff, which suffer from maintenance and reliability issues.
- **Community Features:** Allows fans to watch, upvote, comment on, and collect specials, fostering a vibrant community of standup comedy lovers.
- **Innovative Content Interaction:** Plans to integrate features like inputting special material into GPT to create a virtual standup figure for interactive experiences.

## Legal Disclaimer

Standup Wiki does not host or stream content illegally. We leverage platforms like Bilibili, a US-listed Chinese company, for hosting specials. Users should be aware of the legal nuances of watching content from platforms like Netflix or HBO through third-party sites.
