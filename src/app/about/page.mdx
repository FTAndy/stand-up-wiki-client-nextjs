  You as a standup comedy fan can explore your favorite standup comedian and specials and watch free specials from **Netflix and HBO FOR FREE**.
  <br />
  # Q&A
    ## Why standup wiki
  The motivation is simple. There are no legit websites or platforms that vertically focus on the standup comedy field.
    <br />
  You got official website like 
    <a href="http://www.cc.com" target="_blank">Comedy Center</a>,
    <a href="https://www.netflix.com/jp-en/browse/genre/11559" target="_blank">Netflix</a>,
    and 
    <a href="https://www.hbo.com/specials" target="_blank">HBO</a>. But they are limited and focus on content created by their own comedians.
  <br />
  You got wild website like 
    <a href="https://www.dead-frog.com/" target="_blank">dead-frog</a>,
    and 
    <a href="https://comedybuff.com/" target="_blank">comedybuff</a>. But they are pretty broken and lack maintenance.
  <br />
  There are no platforms that collect all standup comedians and specials and give standup fans to watch, upvote, comment, and collect.
  <br />
  ## Is it illegal to watch Netflix or HBO specials for free?
  Of course it is illegal to upload any Netflix or HBO specials to any video platforms and stream videos to the public.
  <br />
  However! There is a video platform called 
    <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/" target="_blank">Bilibili</a>,. 
    It is a US-listed Chinese company supporting users to upload specials and not be afraid of being accused by Netflix or HBO.
    It is the land of outlaws! By leveraging this advantage, illegal specials can be streamed.
